| LOGIN_009 | Password with Leading/Trailing Spaces | 1. Enter valid username. 2. Enter password with leading/trailing spaces. 3. Click "Login" button. | System should either trim the spaces before authentication or consider the spaces as part of the password and potentially deny access. |  | Check if spaces are trimmed or not accepted. |
| LOGIN_010 | Username - Case Sensitivity | 1. Enter valid username with incorrect casing (e.g., using uppercase instead of lowercase). 2. Enter valid password. 3. Click "Login" button. | System should handle case sensitivity appropriately (either accept or reject based on requirements). Error message should be informative. |  | Note case-sensitivity requirements. |
| LOGIN_011 | Password - Case Sensitivity | 1. Enter valid username. 2. Enter valid password with incorrect casing. 3. Click "Login" button. | System should handle case sensitivity appropriately. Error message should be informative. |  | Note case-sensitivity requirements. |
| LOGIN_012 | Password Visibility Toggle | 1. Enter password. 2. Click "Show Password" (or similar) toggle. 3. Verify password is shown in plain text. 4. Click "Hide Password" (or similar) toggle. 5. Verify password is hidden. | Password visibility toggles work as expected. |  |  |
| LOGIN_013 | Remember Me Functionality | 1. Enter valid username. 2. Enter valid password. 3. Check "Remember Me" (or similar) checkbox. 4. Click "Login" button. 5. Close the browser. 6. Reopen the browser and navigate to the login page. | User should remain logged in (or be automatically logged in) without re-entering credentials. |  | |
| LOGIN_014 | Password Reset Link | 1. Click "Forgot Password" (or similar) link. 2. Follow the password reset process. | User should be able to successfully reset their password and log in with the new password. |  | Requires separate Password Reset Test Plan (see comment). |
| LOGIN_015 | Login with Special Characters in Username | 1. Enter valid username containing special characters (e.g., @, #, $, %, ^, &). 2. Enter valid password. 3. Click "Login" button. | System should handle special characters in the username appropriately (either accept or reject based on requirements). |  | Note accepted special characters. |
| LOGIN_016 | Login with Special Characters in Password | 1. Enter valid username. 2. Enter valid password containing special characters. 3. Click "Login" button. | System should handle special characters in the password appropriately. |  | Note supported special characters. |
| LOGIN_017 | Maximum Password Length | 1. Enter valid username. 2. Enter password exceeding the maximum allowed length. 3. Click "Login" button. | System should either truncate the password to the maximum length or display an error message indicating the password is too long. |  | Determine maximum password length. |
| LOGIN_018 | Minimum Password Length | 1. Enter valid username. 2. Enter password shorter than the minimum allowed length. 3. Click "Login" button. | Error message displayed indicating password is too short. |  | Determine minimum password length. |
| LOGIN_019 | Brute Force Attack Prevention | 1. Enter valid username. 2. Enter incorrect password repeatedly (e.g., 5-10 times). 3. Click "Login" button each time. | Account should be temporarily locked after a certain number of failed login attempts. Implement lockout mechanisms.  Verify lockout period. |  | Verify lockout duration. |
| LOGIN_020 | Concurrent Login (Same User, Different Sessions) | 1. Login with the same user account on two different browsers or devices simultaneously. 2. Perform an action in one session. 3. Observe the behavior in the other session. | Determine expected behavior (e.g., allow concurrent logins, invalidate the older session). |  |  |
| LOGIN_021 | Login with Inactive Account | 1. Attempt to log in with an account that has been deactivated. 2. Click "Login" button. | User should be prevented from logging in and an appropriate error message should be displayed indicating the account is inactive. |  |  |
| LOGIN_022 | SQL Injection Prevention (Username) | 1. Enter a malicious SQL injection string in the username field. 2. Enter valid password. 3. Click "Login" button. | The application should not be vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.  Authentication should fail gracefully, and no sensitive data should be exposed. |  | Security Test |
| LOGIN_023 | SQL Injection Prevention (Password) | 1. Enter valid username. 2. Enter a malicious SQL injection string in the password field. 3. Click "Login" button. | The application should not be vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. Authentication should fail gracefully, and no sensitive data should be exposed. |  | Security Test |
| LOGIN_024 | Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Prevention (Username) | 1. Enter a malicious XSS payload in the username field. 2. Enter valid password. 3. Click "Login" button. | The application should properly sanitize or encode the input to prevent XSS attacks. The XSS payload should not be executed. |  | Security Test |
| LOGIN_025 | Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Prevention (Password) | 1. Enter valid username. 2. Enter a malicious XSS payload in the password field. 3. Click "Login" button. | The application should properly sanitize or encode the input to prevent XSS attacks. The XSS payload should not be executed. |  | Security Test |
| LOGIN_026 | Cookie Security (if using cookies for session management) | 1. Login successfully. 2. Inspect the login cookie. | Verify the cookie is marked as HTTPOnly, Secure (if using HTTPS), and has an appropriate expiration time. |  | Security Test |

**Notes:**

*   This is a comprehensive list, tailor it to your specific application's requirements.
*   Fill in the "Pass/Fail" column after executing each test.
*   Use the "Comments" column to add details about the test results, any issues encountered, or suggestions for improvement.
*   Consider creating separate test plans for related functionality like "Forgot Password" or account registration if they are complex.
*   Security related tests (SQL Injection, XSS) should be performed by qualified security professionals.
*   Prioritize tests based on risk and impact.
*   This test plan assumes a basic username/password authentication.  If your application uses more complex authentication methods (e.g., multi-factor authentication, social logins), you'll need to add tests to cover those scenarios.
